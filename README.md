# Autism Assistive System

## Background
According to the World Health Organization, 1 in 160 children has an autism spectrum disorder.
These children struggle with social interactions on a daily basis. ASD significantly limits their capacity to conduct daily activities and participate in social scenarios. It also imposes significant emotional burden on children with these disorders.

## Problem statement
  Develop a technology-based solution for children suffering from ASD to help them in interacting better in social scenarios, hence making social environments more accessible,     and inclusive for them.
  
## Description of the solution
Our app aims at improving emotional intelligence of the users (suffering from autism) by Gamifying the process.
The game is divided into 3 levels where each level challenges the user to decipher the emotion reflected on the screen through:
* Images (Level 1)
* Audio (Level 2)
* Video (Level 3)

As the game progresses, the difficulty level increases. 
To increase the difficulty level even further, we plan to incorporate the following into the game:
* Various Social Scenarios (Ex- School, Playground, Cafe)
* Characters belonging to diverse set of Age Groups
