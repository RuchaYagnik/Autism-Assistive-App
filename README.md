  Social skills
  Repetitive Behaviors
  Speech and nonverbal communication
 
# Need for an application to treat this disorder: 
  According to the Centre for Disease Control, autism affects and estimated 1 in 54 children in the United States today.
  Signs of autism usually appear by age 2 or 3 and early detection can lead to positive outcomes later in life for people with autism.


# Technologies Used
  Microsoft Azure Power Apps Platform

# Description
  What does the application do ?
  Kids suffering from Autism are not able to decipher the emotions of other people around them, so our application tries to teach them in a fun loving way
  using a game based format about emotions the people are feeling in different scenarios like playground, classroom and restaurant.
  
  Kids suffering from Autism are not able to form habits easily, so we have a habit making module where we divide each habit into some steps and the kid can follow 
  along with the images. We may in future allow parents to add habits they would like their kids to have by creating and storing their own localized step wise habit into the application.
  
  Kids suffering from Autism find it difficult to understand what is the emotion associated with a particular voice, hence we try to teach as well as quiz the kid whether the sound being played is associated with happiness, sadness, anger or fear emotion.
